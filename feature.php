        <h3>Feature 1: Registration and Login</h3>

        <h3>Feature 2: Product</h3>
        <p> In the product section, our system retrieves products directly from the database. This means that if you wish to add or edit products, you can easily access the database to make the necessary changes. The products are categorized into two main types: online products and regular products.<br><br>
            When browsing the products, you will notice that each product is clearly labeled with its corresponding versionâ€”either "Online" or "Regular." <br><br>
            When you find a product you like, you can add it to your cart. At this point, you can specify the desired quantity of the product. As you add items to your cart, the system automatically calculates and updates the total price based on the quantity and individual product prices. This enables you to keep track of your expenses and make adjustments as needed.<br>
            To review and manage the items in your cart, simply click on the "Cart" button. This will provide you with an overview of the selected products, their quantities, and the total price. You can modify the quantities or remove items from the cart if desired.</p>
